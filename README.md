# Configuration of an IDS/IPS

## Objective

The Configuration Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating an IDS/IPS in SOC World. The primary focus was to analyze IDS alerts within a IDS/IPS tool, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world alert scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of  IDS/IPS concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting IDS alerts.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.


### Tools Used


- Suricata for IDS/IPS.
- Fake website to generate alarts to create realistic detection scenarios.

  Making sure all required license are activated

  Enabling Suricata to start detect

testing suricata with fake website to generate alart and the results is yes its working and detecting
